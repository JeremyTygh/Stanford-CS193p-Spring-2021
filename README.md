# Stanford-CS193p-Spring-2021
A programming course using Swift and SwiftUI that is offered by Stanford University online for free.

Stanford's CS193p course, Developing Applications for iOS, explains the fundamentals of how to build applications for iPhone and iPad using SwiftUI. Most recently offered in Spring quarter 2021, the lectures were given to Stanford students in an on-line format due to the novel coronavirus pandemic and are now being made available (at least 2 per week) to all via Stanford's YouTube channel.

The course was also offered (and videos made available) in 2020. That version remains archived here, but if you are new to CS193p content, you'll definitely only need to watch the 2021 videos. The only exceptions are Lectures 11 & 12 of 2020 (Enroute) which contains material not covered in 2021.

On this site, you will be able to find materials that were distributed to students during the quarter such as homework assignment write-ups and demo code. Unfortunately, we cannot offer any of the same kind of direct support we gave our students (on-line Q&A and office hours with teaching staff, homework grading, etc.), but the materials posted here should still be helpful in understanding the lectures as you watch. As we emphasize to our students, doing the homework assignments is absolutely essential to learning the material in this course.

SwiftUI is fairly new, having shipped just over a year before this course was taught. Thus it may well be that by the time you are watching it, some of the course's content will already be out of date as updates to SwiftUI occur, requiring some adjustment as you watch. That is normal for new technology.

The material in this course was not developed with the involvement of, nor was it vetted by, anyone at Apple, so it should not be perceived as "the truth" for how to develop using SwiftUI. We've done our best to understand this technology ourselves in the short time it has been out and then share what we've learned. Enjoy!
